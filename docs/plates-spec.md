# pfUI Octo nameplates: design spec (Plater for 1.12)

Written 21 Oct 2026. User (20 Oct): "https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/plater-nameplates - I want
to implement our own version of this name plate addon into our PFUI with all features and art work".
Target: 1.12.1 build 5875 (OctoWoW), Lua 5.0, pfUI `octo` branch.

## 0. Licence: why nothing of Plater is copied

Plater (Tercio / Team Details!) is **All Rights Reserved** on CurseForge ("All Rights Reserved unless
otherwise explicitly stated", project licence tab, read 21 Oct 2026). Its GitHub repo
(Tercioo/Plater-Nameplates) has no licence file (`"license": null` from the GitHub API). So, as with
TWThreat, **no Plater code and no Plater texture is copied**. Its features are rebuilt from scratch on
pfUI's nameplates, and the artwork is our own, drawn by `tools\MakePlateArt.ps1` (same approach as
the minimap masks), plus the game's own textures. Plater's fonts are not needed: pfUI Octo already
ships Expressway and the Octo fonts (Roboto, Fira...).

Reference: the user gave Plater v661 (`Downloads\Plater-v661.zip`, 21 Oct 2026). Only its setting
names and default colours were read, as a feature checklist (Plater_DefaultSettings.lua: about 80
aura settings, 37 extra-indicator, 45 cast / cast bar, 18 indicator, 13 range, 12 auto-toggle, 15
boss mod). Its DPS colours agree with ours: aggro red, `noaggro` / `notontank` blue-purple
(.5, .5, 1), pulling yellow-orange; tanks also get `pulling_from_tank` (a tank taking it from another
tank) - phase 3.

## 1. Plater's features, mapped to this client

Plater's options tabs (from its long-standing public feature set: General, Threat & Aggro, Target,
Cast Bar, Level & Strata, Personal Bar, Buff Settings / Tracking / Special, Ghost Auras, Enemy NPC,
Enemy Player, Friendly NPC, Friendly Player, Colors, Npc Colors & Names, Cast Colors & Names,
Scripting, Modding, Profiles, Auto, Animations, Search). The CurseForge description only adds: 500+
settings, aggro colours that flip for tanks, smaller plates out of combat, quest colouring, Lua
scripts and mods with their own options, wago.io updates.

Data on this client: SuperWoW (installed) gives each plate's GUID (`plate:GetName(1)`) and lets every
`Unit*` call take that GUID (health, target of the mob, buffs, debuffs; pfUI's libcast fills
`UnitCastingInfo(guid)` from SuperWoW's cast events). UnitXP_SP3 (installed) gives
`UnitXP("distanceBetween", "player", guid)` (yards) and `UnitXP("inSight", "player", guid)` (boolean) -
both used on GUIDs by Cursive here. ClassicAPI gives `C_UnitAuras.GetUnitAuras(unit)` with expiry
times. Server threat for the current target: pfUI Octo's `pfUI.meters.threat.list` (TWT protocol).

## 2. Architecture

- `modules/plates.lua`, module "plates", loaded right after "nameplates". It wraps
  `pfUI.nameplates` (OnCreate / OnConfigChange / OnDataChanged / OnUpdate are looked up on the
  table each call, so wrapping them before the first plate exists covers every plate). pfUI's file
  stays as upstream. Our parts live in `nameplate.octo` (indicators, glow, spark, icons).
- Settings `C.plates` (pfUI strings, "1" / "0"), defaults in api/config.lua, so profile strings
  carry them. pfUI's own `C.nameplates` keys keep working and are shown on our pages.
- `modules/plates-options.lua`: the "Nameplates" section in OctoBG's look (O:AddPage), with every
  pfUI nameplate setting plus ours; pfUI's own "Nameplates" category is hidden from the topic list
  (`O.replaced`), as combat text's was.
- Art: `tools\MakePlateArt.ps1` -> `img\plates\*.tga` (white, tinted in game).

## 3. Phase 1 (this release)

Art (all 32-bit TGA, white + alpha, drawn with 4 x 4 samples):
`bar-flat, bar-soft, bar-gloss, bar-glass, bar-split` (256 x 32 bar fills), `arrow` (64, points
right; mirrored by tex coords), `chevron` (double arrow, 64), `corner` (32, an L; turned for the four
corners), `underglow` (256 x 64 soft light under the bar), `spark` (32 x 64), `star` (32, elite /
rare), `skull` (32, boss), `tick` (8 x 32, execute marker).

Behaviour:
- Look: bar texture (ours + pfUI's list), background colour and alpha, border colour, name font and
  size, health text font size.
- Size: per kind (enemy NPC, enemy player, friendly NPC, friendly player) as % of pfUI's width /
  height, out-of-combat %, target %; done with the overlay's scale and eased over 0.15 s.
- Threat: role auto (warrior in Defensive Stance, druid in bear form, paladin with Righteous Fury)
  / tank / damage. States, from the mob's target (GUID.."target") and, for your target, the server's
  threat list:
  - damage / healer: `aggro` (attacking you, red), `pulling` (you are at >= N % of the tank,
    orange), `safe` (attacking someone else: blue-purple, or the normal colour - pfUI's normal
    enemy colour is red, which would look like aggro);
  - tank: `aggro` (attacking you, blue-green), `losing` (someone else >= N % of you, orange),
    `offtank` (attacking another tank, purple), `lost` (attacking a non-tank, red);
  - only while you and the mob are in combat. Tanks = pfUI's raid tank roles + its off-tank list.
  - aggro glow (pfUI's img:glow edge) on `aggro` (damage) / `lost` (tank), optional.
- Target: indicator none / arrows / chevrons / corners / underglow, colour (accent by default),
  mouseover highlight on the bar.
- Execute: auto (warrior, paladin) / on / off at N % (20): bar colour and a marker on the bar.
- Cast bar, Plater layout (icon left of the bar, spell name left, time right, spark, fade out) or
  pfUI's layout. Colours: cast, channel, finished, interrupted. "Interrupted by NAME" for 1 s from
  SPELLINTERRUPTSELFOTHER / SPELLINTERRUPTOTHEROTHER lines, matched to the plate by name.
- Range: plates of units further than N yards (UnitXP) fade to an alpha; units out of line of sight
  fade too (option). Checked every 0.2 s per plate. Without UnitXP: off.
- Elite / rare / boss icon left of the name.
- Looks: "Plater look" (130 x 12 bars, health % in the middle, arrows, Plater cast bar), "Slim" and
  "pfUI look" buttons (`pfUI.plates.ApplyPreset`); the Plater look is applied once on first load
  (`C.plates.firstlook`). `docs\plates-preview.png` is a drawing of it from the real textures.

Not verified in game (all of phase 1): every look, the scale easing with pfUI's click area, the
threat states, UnitXP on plate GUIDs, the interrupt lines' wording on this server.

## 4. Phase 2: auras (done 21 Oct 2026, not seen in game)

`modules/plates-auras.lua` (`pfUI.plates.Auras`), hooked from plates.lua (Configure / Update /
Tick / Off). While `C.plates.auras` is on, pfUI's own debuff row is skipped (showdebuffs is set to
"0" only for the length of pfUI's OnDataChanged, put back even on an error).
- Data: SuperWoW `UnitDebuff(guid, i)` -> texture, stacks, type, spell id; `UnitBuff(guid, i)` ->
  texture, stacks, spell id; names by `SpellInfo(id)`, else pfUI libdebuff's tooltip scan (only when
  a slot changes, `o.acache`). Your own debuffs' timers and "mine" from libdebuff.objects (no scan).
  ClassicAPI `C_UnitAuras.GetUnitAuras(unit, "HARMFUL" / "HELPFUL")` end times and sourceGUID when
  it returns them - field names assumed retail-like, NOT verified.
- Row above the name: debuffs (yours / yours + crowd control (default) / all, pfUI's black / white
  list), then enemy buffs (important (default) / all / none); order yours, CC, other debuffs,
  important buffs. Icons 20 x 16 (cropped), rows of N, 1-3 rows, grow middle / left / right; timer
  (minutes, whole seconds, tenths under 3 s in red), stacks, edge by debuff type, important buffs gold.
- Special auras: names list -> big icons (28) on top, accent edge (default: main CC and immunities).
- Ghost auras: your listed debuffs missing on a mob fighting you, desaturated, icons from your
  spellbook; a button fills the list with your class's usual ones. Off by default.
- Preview: the target sample shows pretend auras, the threat sample one of yours plus ghosts;
  "Test on real nameplates" puts pretend auras on every plate too.

## 5. Phase 3: lists, quests, icons, auto (done 21 Oct 2026, not seen in game)

`modules/plates-lists.lua` (`pfUI.plates.Lists`), hooked from plates.lua.
- NPC colours and names (`C.plates.npclist`) and cast colours and spell names (`castlist`): strings
  "Name|r,g,b|New name#..." so profile strings carry them. Bar colour order: execute, threat, NPC
  colour (wins over threat with `npcoverthreat`), quest colour (`questbar`), pfUI's own.
  Options page "Colours and names": an editor per list (name, colour, new name, Use my target /
  No colour / Save / Remove) and the list below it.
- Quest marks right of the name: pfQuest's `pfMap.tooltips[name][quest][map].QTYPE`
  (UNIT_OBJECTIVE / _ITEMREQ / ITEM_OBJECTIVE_LOOT = objective diamond, NPC_START = "!",
  NPC_END = "?"); without pfQuest, quest log lines "X slain: a/b" not done (QUEST_MONSTERS_KILLED,
  checked in every patch's GlobalStrings.lua).
- Class icon on enemy (default) / friendly players (pfUI's img:classicons), paw on pets
  (UnitPlayerControlled, not a player).
- Auto: enemy plates in / out of combat, friendly plates in cities (list by zone name) / dungeons
  and raids (IsInInstance party / raid) / open world: Leave, On, Off. Runs after pfUI's own
  PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD show / hide, on zone change and combat start / end.
- Tank state `taking` (Plater's pulling_from_tank): the mob is on another tank and you are at the
  pull %, colour `c_taking`.
- Art: quest-objective, quest-start, quest-end, pet (tools\MakePlateArt.ps1).

## 6. Later phases

3. Lists and indicators (NPC colours, cast colours, quest units, class / pet icons, name-only friends,
   Auto tab, personal bar).
4. Animations, scripts / mods, nameplate-only presets.
